This is a fork, to back up the code that is running on the Zen CNC garden at Vancouver's Mini Maker Faire 2016. I have done some minor changes that are only useful for my machine. Check out http://www.makelangelo.com/ for the good code.

A mural drawing robot and a gentle introduction to 3D printing

Makelangelo is a polargraph mural drawing robot.  It is intended to teach students about programming, physics, trigonometry, and electronics in a fun, goal-oriented way.  Makelangelo is scalable: our test models have ranged from 30cm^2 to 300cm^2.

This project specifically deals with the firmware: the code in the brain of the robot that receives instructions and moves the motors.  It pairs really well with Makelangelo, a project to give humans a pleasant GUI.

Makelangelo is derived from the work of Paul Fisher.  It is largely inspired by "Hektor":http://hektor.ch/ by Jürg Lehni and Uli Franke.
